# FogForge — Pricing Tiers (Provider Subscriptions)

FogForge is subscription-first (SaaS), not pay-per-lead.
Leads always enter FogForge, always appear in Admin, and delivery rules determine what providers receive.

Plans apply to ONE home metro. Additional metros are add-ons.

## Metro Add-ons
Plans include ONE home metro.

Additional metros are add-ons:

Pricing should scale with demand. High-demand metros may be priced higher later.
Initial recommendation: keep add-ons simple + flat-rate until you have data.
